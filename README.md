### Project
Inspired by critismims of new school rap compared to old school rap (https://thespellbinder.net/2832/features/evolution-of-rap-lyrics/ , https://medium.com/@geneduterte/hip-hop-the-evolution-of-lyricism-c7b01aff29b2), we will be examining...

Criticisms around lyrics: “repetitive chants”, “"sound identical"; "same beats and lyrics", “decline of lyricism”, “simplistic styles”
Criticisms around themes: that new school rap is more about drugs, money, and girls rather than the "social and political awareness" that was prominent in old school rap

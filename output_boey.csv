the kitchen some have banners that say happy marriage some have sparklers they all bounce on beat its cute for a very short moment then it feels wrong all the creatures have two legs two arms like humans  but they are definitely not humans one of the giveaways being that they are naked but dont seem to have genitals all the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths theyre about three feet high their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces they dont have hair anywhere on their bodies they all have forced smiles on their faces you can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile insinuating carnivorous behavior if they wanted to at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in 8 seconds but theyre not right now theyre marching one of the creatures has tears in its eyes still smiling tho pushing the smile everyone is smiling as they march past but theyre all very cautious clearly worried that one may attack the boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle they do this weird clapping almost step team routine then stop the music stops creature 1 we did it creature 2 yay everyone claps the bride and groom force a smile the creatures slowly make their way back to the kitchen all thats heard is their struggled breathing and clammy skin hitting the wooden dance floor one stares at the boy as he  leaves,4.845083333333333,1079,222.69998796030342

waste its like cutting off your nose to spite your face and at the end of the wars what was the cost its clear that the earth was the one who lost we are one with her as she is one with us its unreal how she is treated so unjust as our planet grows smaller each and every day everyone affecting everyone in every way were all citizens of the world community all here together and were searching for unity over the years ive grown and changed so much things i know now years ago i couldnt touch there are things ive done that i wouldnt do again but im glad that i did cause ive learned from them i just try to stay present right here right now no worries no fears and without any doubts its about time cause in these times these changing times a transition is occuring and i am not blind as the pendlum swings a new age we enter and with every swing it draws closer to the center yes the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love things must run their course so we push and we shove but were here to work it out in one way or another to find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another and the true key is a trust in self for when i trust myself i fear no one else i took control of my life just as anyone can i want everyone to see its in the palm of your hand the past is gone the future yet unborn but right here and now is where it all goes on i know we can fix it and its not too late i give respect to king and his nonviolent ways i dream and i hope and i wont forget someday im going to visit on a free tibet someday im going to see us all joined as one and it would be too bad to blow it up before were done cause we long behind the rage learning from the pain the love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain im sending loving light to all that is to all creation and the life we live im not preaching bull shit just speaking my mind cause im here now and its about time when two are served you may begin to eat gene futterman because i grab the microphone and i

throwing rhymes down kicking them downtown traveling high speed through the underground i kick it free style make it worth your while ive got shelves of rhymes that i keep on file im feeling good now back home again new york city is the city that i feel at home in a blast from the grasshoff awhile its been stepping into the future again im straight from the 88 to 93 to 94 im out the door step into

but now im back again im feeling strong see trust myself g well i stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key weve got fire we need water there aint no water so i guess i ought to leave you broke in a comatose state of mind and im blind and im working overtime so check it i keep my rhymes in a little black book and i know you want to take another look as i develop the awakening mind i praise the buddha as they shine i bow before you as i travel my path to join your ranks i make my full time task for the sake of all beings i seek the enlighted mind that i know ill reap respect to shantideva and all the others who brought down the darma for sisters and brothers i give thanks for this world as a place to learn and for this human body that i know ive earned and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings for without them there would be no place to learn what im seeing theres nothing here thats not been said before but i put it down now so ill be sure to solidify my own views and ill be glad if it helps anyone else out too if others disrespect me or give me flack ill stop and think before i react knowing that theyre going through insecure stages ill take the opportunity to exercise patience ill see it as a chance to help the other person nip it in the bud before it can worsen a change for me to be strong and sure as i think on the buddhas who have come before as i praise and respect the good theyve done knowing only love can conquer in every situation we need other people in order to create the circumstances for the learning that were here to generate situations that bring up our deepest fears so we can work to release them until theyre cleared therefore it only makes sense to thank our enemies despite their intent the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength a strength from within to go the length seeing others are as important as myself i strive for a happiness of mental wealth with the interconnectedness that we share as one every action that we take affects everyone so in deciding for what a situation calls there is a path for the good for all i try to make my every action for that highest good with the altruistic wish to achive buddhahood so i pledge here before everyone whos listening to try to make my every action for the good of all beings for the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond i vow to do my best to do no harm and in times of doubt i can think on the dharma,2.974,1408,473.43644922663077
